- Understand what the questionaire is trying to ask you for?
- Be organised.
- Uplift me also with you.
- Stick to the topic.
- Don't justify yourself, when uncessary.
- Defend to the death, when you are not wrong, and someone is trying to force something into you. Don't your ever accept that.
- You may win the person's company, but you will lose the god, within the process.
