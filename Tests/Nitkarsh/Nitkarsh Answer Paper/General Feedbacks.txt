Positive Improvements:

1) You are using visualization aids, which is a good way to demonstrate it.
2) You are using outline method of answering questions which is a good way to write clean answers.
3) Your connection are sometimes original which is a good way of displaying your creativity.

Negative Aspects:

1) Some of your answers are vaguely answered which gives the impression of a ignorant person trying to attempt assumptuous answers. (If you don't know then cut it short, don't try to stretch, write qualitative answers not quantative.)
2) If you need marks desperately then clear your concepts instead of relying just on assumptions. (This can only take place when you sincerely study for the understanding and not just for marks.) Be vary of your assumptions. Be very vary of your assumptions. Don't assume the meaning of the core concept.
3) You should consider improving your handwriting. ( You can become concious here and there during exams about your handwriting. Don't force yourself to improve just watch what are the things you are doing wrong)
4) You need to work upon your question understanding skills. The test were given to know what your know and how well you understand not your lieing skills.
