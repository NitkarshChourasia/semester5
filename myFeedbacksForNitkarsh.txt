Nitkarsh, you need to work upon your hardware knowledge, even if theoratical, telling from the perspective of the goal you are setting, which is pragramtic Approach in creating IoT devices. If you just want to do practicals, you can opt for basic connection and basic knowledge about basic electronic components covered in our practicals, like LEDs, Oscilloscope, etc. I have no desire to build a pragmatic IoT device. I don't intend to in the future as well. Because I have my own commitments. Thank you.
