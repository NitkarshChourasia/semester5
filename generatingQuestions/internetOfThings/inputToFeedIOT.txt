In the context "BSc IT" and the subject "Internet of Things", generate 60 questions, 12 for each unit as there are 5 units in the text given above and divide the questions in each unit chapterwise equally. For example, If a unit have 3 chapters then generate only 4 questions for each chapter, if a unit have 2 chapters then generate only 6 questions for each chapter, if a unit have only 1 chapter then generate all 12 questions for that chapter. Take the help of subtopics in each chapter to generate appropriate questions:
