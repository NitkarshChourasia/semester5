- This is not called organisation.
- How would you organise with respect to lots of QB generations and their questions.
- Don't you think some tags like date, testNo:1, and some other tags, it should be organised in a folder or something?
- Don;t you think tracking it with some excel or something would be good?
- Or you can create a excel file and link all the files in the adjacent column or row with date column and marks our own specified.
- We are about to take this kind of test for lots of times and days.
- Don't you think tracking them is of importance and organisation of them.
- Like data analytics we should be able to perfom with full data tracking.
- Accountability???
- Fuck, you, no analysis of future events.
- Iterate it. Your sole responsibility it is. Now.
